# 3D 🏗️
3D printing is on the rise only becoming more popular as printer prices become more affordable.

Here is my custom repo for all my different 3D projects.

## Projects:
### [Rockingham County Chiropractic](./rockinghamCountyChiropractic)
A local chiropractor has patient's 'take a number' while waiting to be adjusted. These numbers are resusable pieces of plastic used over and over again. They sit in a stack on the desk, succeptible toppling over.

So I designed a 'toaster' model, complete with their logo, to keep them secure.
